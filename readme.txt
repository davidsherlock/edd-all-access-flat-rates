Override the All Access weighted commission calculation and reward vendors with flat rate amounts.

== Description ==

**All Access Flat Rates** for Easy Digital Downloads allows you to override the weighted All Access commission calculations and reward vendors with a more straight forward flat rate amount per product downloaded.

== Use-case Examples ==

Letâ€™s look at some real-world examples of how All Access Flat Rates could potentially be utilised in different scenarios:

* You sell and All Access pass for $100 per month and have 50 products on your site by 5 vendors on your site. Each time a customer downloads an All Access product the vendor receives $0.25 for each unique download.
* Weighted calculations can be confusing, flat rate amounts are easier for your vendors to understand. 1 download = one flat fee.
* Some products on your store are not part of the All Access pass, and vendors receive a percentage for each item sold. These items are ignored from the flat rate calculations.

== Features ==

* Easily set a global flat rate amount that will automatically override the weighted commission calculations
* View a breakdown of which products were downloaded and the total commission earnings on a per-commission basis
* Seamless integration with Easy Digital Downloads and Commissions settings
* Translation-ready and contains a POT file to help get you started translating into your own native language
* Have a specific use-case? All Access Flat Rates includes plenty of developer-ready filters and action hooks to make it possible!
* Developed using the best practices, with security, extensibility, and readability in mind
